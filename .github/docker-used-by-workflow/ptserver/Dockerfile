# Why not use official node image?
#   If there is a problem I can go inside docker container and debug. Since supervisor is process 1 stopping node will not stop the container.

# Supervisor services files are mounted in docker-compose as that allows changing services.conf without needing to rebuild docker image
# COPY etc-supervisor-conf.d-services.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/services.conf coming from docker-compose easier to change since new image does not need to be pushed
